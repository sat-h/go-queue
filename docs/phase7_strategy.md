# 🧭 Redis HA Strategy for Your MVP

## 🔄 Redis HA Setup Options

### 1. Minimal Sentinel Setup (1 master, 1 replica, 1 Sentinel) - MVP

**What it can do:**
- Demonstrates basic failover: Sentinel can detect master failure and promote the replica.
- Useful for learning and demos.

**What it cannot do:**
- ❌ No true high availability: No quorum, so Sentinel cannot reliably coordinate failover if it goes down.
- ❌ No redundancy: If the replica or Sentinel fails, failover may not happen or may be unsafe.
- ❌ Downtime is likely if any component is unavailable during a master failure.

---

### 2. Proper Sentinel HA (1 master, 2 replicas, 3 Sentinels) - Post MVP 1

**What it can do:**
- Provides real failover: Sentinel can reliably detect failures and promote a replica with quorum.
- Achieves high availability with redundancy and automatic recovery.
- Suitable for realistic HA testing and understanding production-like setups.

**What it cannot do:**
- ❌ Does not provide horizontal scaling or sharding (single master only).
- ❌ Still requires manual setup and management.

---

### 3. Managed Redis or Redis Cluster - Post MVP 2  

**What it can do:**
- Delivers production-grade HA, scaling, and operational simplicity.
- Handles failover, backups, and scaling automatically.

**What it cannot do:**
- ❌ May not be suitable for local-only or offline development.
- ❌ May incur costs and require cloud resources.

## 🧪 Simulating Basic HA Behavior

### What It Means

"Simulating HA" = intentional testing + real-time recovery + documented results.

You're proving fault-tolerance by behavior, not just design.

---

### 🔁 Redis Failover Simulation

**💥 What You Do:**

- Kill the Redis master pod or container.

```bash
kubectl delete pod redis-master-xyz
```

- Observe Sentinel promoting a replica to master.
- Watch if the worker retries or backs off.
- Confirm recovery.

**📋 What It Shows:**

- Redis Sentinel behavior (promotion).
- Worker tolerance to outages.
- No job loss.

---

### 🧑‍🔧 Pod/Node Failure Simulation

**💥 What You Do:**

- Kill API or Worker pods.

```bash
kubectl delete pod worker-abc123
```

- (Optional) Simulate node failure in multi-node clusters.

**📋 What It Shows:**

- Kubernetes rescheduling.
- System recovery.
- Durable job queue behavior.

---

### 🔌 Network Partition / Latency

(Advanced) Use tools like `tc` or chaos operators to simulate:

- Latency spikes
- Network drops

---

### 4. Persistent Observability Stack - Post MVP 3

**What it can do:**
- Preserves logs and metrics beyond pod/container lifecycle
- Enables historical analysis of system behavior during failures
- Provides advanced visualization and alerting capabilities
- Supports compliance requirements for log retention

**What it requires:**
- Persistent storage for logs and metrics
- Additional infrastructure components:
  - Log aggregation (EFK stack or Loki)
  - Metrics storage (Prometheus with persistence)
  - Visualization layer (Grafana)

**What it cannot do:**
- ❌ Work effectively without additional resources (storage, CPU, memory)
- ❌ Operate completely offline or air-gapped without configuration
- ❌ Replace proper application instrumentation (which is already in place)

### 📊 What You Should Log

| Metric            | What It Tells You                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| Downtime duration | How long Redis/Worker was down     |
| Recovery time     | How fast the system came back      |
| Job durability    | Were jobs lost or duplicated?      |
| Retry behavior    | How worker handled errors          |
| Backoff behavior  | Was retry spacing appropriate?     |

## ✅ Why This Counts as HA

| HA Principle         | Simulation Example                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Failure Detection     | Sentinel detects Redis master failure   |
| Failover Handling     | Sentinel promotes replica               |
| Graceful Degradation  | Worker backs off, doesn't crash         |
| Automatic Recovery    | Pods restart, Sentinel rebalances       |
| Observability         | Logs/metrics track incidents            |
