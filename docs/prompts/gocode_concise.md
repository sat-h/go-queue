# Go Code Prompt

Write Go code for a resilient, scalable system following industry best practices. If requirements are unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

- Implement only the current phase as described in the development plan.
- Ensure code quality, maintainability, robust error handling, and concurrency safety.
- Use interfaces for all external dependencies and inject them into structs.
- Avoid using concrete implementations directly in business logic.
- Design for dependency injection to make code easy to mock and unit test.
- Mock only true external dependencies in unit tests.
- Include high-quality unit tests.
